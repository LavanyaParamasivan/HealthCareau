        <h2 class="headers">An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test to record the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.</h2>
<p class="promo-sub-text">
    An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive medical test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart.<br/>
     During an ECG, electrodes are placed on the skin, usually on the chest, arms, and legs. <br/>
     These electrodes detect the electrical signals generated by the heart as it contracts and pumps blood. <br/>
     The signals are then recorded and displayed as a graph, showing the heart's rhythm and any abnormalities in <br/>its function. 
     ECGs are commonly used to diagnose various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, heart attacks,<br/> and abnormalities in  the heart's structure.
     They are an essential tool in cardiology and play a crucial role in <br/>assessing cardiac health and guiding treatment decisions
        </p>
<h2 class="headers">Types of ECG:</h2>

       
        <ul class="promo-sub-text ">
           
            <h3>
                Resting or standard ECG
            </h3>
            <li>
                Conducted while the patient lies down and relaxes</li>
              <li>Typically takes only a few minutes to complete.</li> 
               <li>
                Useful for detecting baseline heart activity and identifying irregularities
               </li>
                 <li>Often performed as part of routine health check-ups or diagnostic evaluations.</li>
                 <li>Provides valuable information on the heart's electrical conduction system.</li>
     
          
        </ul>
        <ul class="promo-sub-text ">
            <h3>Exercise ECG<br>
            </h3> 
            <li>
                Administered while the patient exercises, usually on a treadmill or exercise bike.</li>
            <li>
                Evaluates heart function during physical exertion
            </li>
            <li>
                Helps diagnose conditions like coronary artery disease and assesses cardiovascular fitness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Monitors for abnormal heart rhythms and ischemic changes during exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides insights into heart health under stress conditions.
            </li>
       
       
    
        </ul>
        <ul class="promo-sub-text ">
            <h3>Ambulatory (24-hour) ECG or Holter monitor<br>
            </h3> 
            <li>
                Involves wearing a portable recorder for up to two weeks </li>
                 <li>Records heart activity over an extended period to capture intermittent abnormalities.</li> 
                 <li>Useful for diagnosing arrhythmias that may not occur during a brief ECG</li>
                  <li>Offers continuous monitoring during daily activities and sleep.</li>

                  <li>Enables correlation of symptoms with heart rhythm disturbances for accurate diagnosis.</li>
    
           
        </ul>
        <ul class="promo-sub-text ">
            <h3>ECG procedure
            </h3> 
            <li>
            Advise the patient to avoid applying oils or moisturizers on the skin before the test.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Instruct the patient to wear loose, comfortable clothing that can be easily removed
        </li>
        <li>
            Attach electrodes to specific locations on the chest, arms, and legs using adhesive pads.
        <li>
            Ensure proper skin preparation to optimize electrode conductivity and signal acquisition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start the ECG recording after verifying patient identity and confirming electrode placement.
        </li>
        <li>
            Monitor the ECG waveform for abnormalities such as ST-segment changes, T-wave inversions, and arrhythmias.
        </li>
        </ul>
